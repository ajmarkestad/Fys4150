Benchmarks for Project3 code:

Each folder represents a run of the program with different numerical methods, i.e. Euler, Verlet, ect.
and is named by the terminal input values for the program that is used to produce the benchmarks.
The __ represents a single space " " that divides the input parameters when running the code, the _ represents _
This folder also contains the initial data files used.

The folder will contain a text file with the terminal input/output and the data file produced by the program.

As such we use small runs of the program, i.e. small number of timesteps, to keep these files small.
