##Project 1: Tridiagonal solver

To run the files:
- Change the Project1.pro to fit your compiler
- run the Project1.py script that runs the make, runs the executable and makes the plots. 

Code contains if test to stop it from running with LU-decomposition and to stop it from writing too large data output files for large n, so select n values with impunity (Select different n values in main.cpp)

##Project 2: Quantum Mechanical Oscillators
To run the files:
- Probably recompile to a release version in the Project2 folder
- Change the parameters in the Project2.py script to get the correct values of grid_size, omega and Columb factor
- Run python3 Project2.py

This does not save the data, but makes plots with the 3 lowers energy eigenstates and the eigenvalues.
