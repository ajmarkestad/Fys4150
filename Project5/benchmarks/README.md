## Benchmarks 
The file test.py hold an example of a run with non-trivial parameters and makes the plots and fits the tail to a function. In the file historic_powers.txt the fitted values reside with some error of the fits for each of the parameters that was fitted. 
'python3 test.py'
Should reproduce all these results.
Otherwise is is possible to run the file Project5 directly, by following the convension:
'''
./main (outputfile) (int total number of runs)  (int number of histogram bins) (int number of agents) (int initial cycles) (int transactions per run) (double lambda) (double gamma) (double alpha) (double normalization)
'''
